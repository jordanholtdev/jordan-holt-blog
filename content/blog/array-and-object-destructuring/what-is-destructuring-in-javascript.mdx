The destructuring syntax in JavaScript was introduced in ES6 and is a powerful expression that makes working with Arrays and
Objects much more manageable and provides added flexibility. You might have already been using destructuring when importing  
JavaScript modules without knowing it.

Using the destructuring assignment syntax we can unpack values from Arrays and properties from Objects
and assign them into distinct variables.

Lets have a look at the basics of destructuring assignment.

## Array destructuring

Using the destructuring syntax we can unpack specific values from an Array and assign them to a variable.
Here is an example using basic variable assignment with.

```javascript
const nameArray = ["Joe", "Frank", "Katherine", "Lisa"]

const [a, b, c] = nameArray
console.log(a)
```

Expected output:

```code
"Joe"
```

We can also assign variable values seperately from the declaration.

```javascript
let a, b

;[a, b] = ["Joe", "Frank"]
console.log(a, b)
```

Expected output:

```code
"Joe", "Frank"
```

#### ...rest

Using the rest pattern we unpack the remaining values in an Array to one variable.

```javascript
let a

;[a, ...rest] = ["Joe", "Frank", "Katherine", "Lisa"]
console.log(rest)
```

Expected output:

```code
["Frank", "Katherine", "Lisa"]
```

We can name the variable using the ..rest pattern to something other than rest, depending on our use case.

```javascript
let a, b

;[a, ...remainingNames] = ["Joe", "Frank", "Katherine", "Lisa"]
console.log(remainingNames)
```

## Object destructuring

Using the same syntax we can extract values from Objects as well using basic desctructuring assignment.

```javascript
const motorcycle = {
  engineType: "750cc",
  type: "cruiser",
  color: "red",
  used: true,
  mileage: 1000,
}

const { color, used, mileage } = motorcycle
console.log(color, used, mileage)
```

Expected output:

```code
"red", true, 1000
```

We can also use the desctructuring assignment without a variable declaration, with some addtional requirements.

```javascript
let color, mileage

;({ color, mileage, ...rest } = {
  engineType: "750cc",
  type: "cruiser",
  color: "red",
  used: true,
  mileage: 1000,
})
console.log(color, mileage)
```

Notice about how we wrapped the assignment statement in parentheses (...) which is required when not using
a variable decleration.

## Combining Array and Object destructuring

We commonly work with Arrays of Objects in JavaScript. We can combine Array and Object desctructuring.
For example if we wanted to extract the name property from the first Object in the users Array below.

```javascript
const users = [
  { user: 1, name: "Joe" },
  { user: 2, name: "Lisa" },
  { user: 3, name: "Fred" },
]

const [{ name }, b, c] = users
console.log(name)
```

Expected output:

```code
"Joe"
```

## Wrap up

In this post we saw how we can use the destructuring syntax in JavaScript to extract values from Arrays and Objects.
This can be a great way to cleanly access values. I'll be diving deeper into destructuring in future posts.
