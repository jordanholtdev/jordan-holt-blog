Switch statements are a useful when you need to evaluate an expression against multiple possibilities. They can be a great alternative to other conditional statements like using multiple else if statements.

Lets have a look and see how to use them.

## Basic switch statement syntax

Let's have a look at the syntax of a basic switch statement. Here's an example:

```javascript
const expr = "Hand soap"

switch (expr) {
  case "Hand soap":
    console.log("Hand soap is $1.29.")
}
```

You must use the `switch` keyword, followed by parenthesis () which will accept the expression to be evaluated, the `case` keyword that will evaluate the expression that was passed into the statement and a colon (" : ") that will indicate the start of the code block to be run if that case evaluates true.

In the example above, the `case` evaluates to true so the code block will run and log `Hand soap is $1.29.` to the console.

When the expression being evaluated is true the switch statement executes the associated cases code block, as well statements that follow the matching case.

If you run the following code you will see that both case statements are executed and the console will log `Hand soap is $1.29.` and `Deodorant is $2.59 each.`.

```javascript
const expr = "Hand soap"

switch (expr) {
  case "Hand soap":
    console.log("Hand soap is $1.29.")
  case "Deodorant":
    console.log("Deodorant is $2.59 each.")
}
```

## Break statement

You can use the `break` statement to make sure the program breaks out of the switch logic once the matching statement is executed.

```javascript
const item = "Hand soap"

switch (item) {
  case "Hand soap":
    console.log("Hand soap is $1.29.")
    break
  case "Deodorant":
    console.log("Deodorant is $2.59 each.")
    break
}
```

Once a matched statement executes the program will break out of the switch statement.

## Default clause

If no matching cases are found we can use a `default` clause with an associated code block that will exucute.

```javascript
const item = "Face masks"

switch (item) {
  case "Hand soap":
    console.log("Hand soap is $1.29.")
    break
  case "Deodorant":
    console.log("Deodorant is $2.59 each.")
    break
  default:
    console.log(`Sorry, we are out of ${item}.`)
}
```

## Multiple cases

You can also take advatange of the optional `break` statement to create helpful logic.

Here we use multiple cases with a single operation that will execute if any of those cases are true.

```javascript
const item = "Shampoo"

switch (item) {
  case "Hand soap":
  case "Deodorant":
  case "Shampoo":
  case "Toothpaste":
    console.log(`${item} is on sale!`)
    break
  default:
    console.log(`${item} is not on sale right now.`)
}
```

The example above is known as a multi-case single operation statement. We have multiple cases that will perform the same operation.

We could can also have multiple cases and chain operations for more complex logic:

```javascript
const memberLevel = 4
let message = "You get free: "

switch (memberLevel) {
  case 5:
    message += "Personal coaching, "
  case 4:
    message += "Monthly group calls "
  case 3:
    message += "Private FB group, "
  case 2:
    message += "Email suport, "
  case 1:
    message += "Tutorials"
    message += "!"
    console.log(message)
    break
  case 0:
    console.log("Thanks for becoming a memeber! Have a free t-shirt!")
    break
  default:
    console.log("Join now to become a member with great benefits!")
}
```

## Wrap up

If your control flow logic uses several else if statements or is becoming verbose and difficult to read then consider using a switch statement.
