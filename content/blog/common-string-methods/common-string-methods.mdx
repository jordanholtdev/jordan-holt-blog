Working with strings in JavaScript can be a breeze if you take advantage of 
the built-in string methods.  Here are a few of the most commonly used string methods in JavaScript.

### slice()

The slice() method is a non-destructive method that extracts a certain section of the string and returns that 
section as a new string. 

It takes two parameters:

1. **beginIndex** - The index at which you would like the extraction to begin.
2. **endIndex** - The index at which the extraction will end. This index will not be included in 
the new string.

```javascript
const vaderQuote = "I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further";

const newStr = vaderQuote.slice(0, 23);
console.log(newStr); // expected output: "I am altering the deal."
```

If we omit the endIndex then the slice() method extracts to the end of the string. 

```javascript
const vaderQuote = "I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further";

const newStr = vaderQuote.slice(31);
console.log(newStr); // expected output: "don’t alter it any further"
```

We can also pass in negative indexes to the slice() method. 

```javascript
const vaderQuote = "I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further";

const newStr = vaderQuote.slice(-33);
console.log(newStr); // expected output: "Pray I don’t alter it any further"
```
In the example above slice() counts backwards by 33  and then 
returns the rest of that string.

And here is an example using a negative endIndex. Slice() starts to extract the string from index 5, and then
counts backwards from the end of the string to find the endIndex at -21.

```javascript
const vaderQuote = "I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further";

const newStr = vaderQuote.slice(5, -21);
console.log(newStr); // expected output: "altering the deal. Pray I don’t"
```

You can use any integer for the begin and end index. 

```javascript
const vaderQuote = "I am altering the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further";
const lukeQuote = "You’ll find I’m full of surprises";

const strtIndex = vaderQuote.length - lukeQuote.length;

const newStr = vaderQuote.slice(strtIndex, -12);
console.log(newStr); // expected output: "Pray I don’t alter it"
```

### lastIndexOf()

The lastIndexOf() method returns the index of the last appearance of a string that is passed into the
searchValue.

Here's a break down of the parameters:

1. **searchValue** - Takes a string that will act as the search value. 
The searchValue is case sensitive.
2. **fromIndex** - This is an optional parameter which when set, will indicate the last
character to be considered in the search. 

Let's have a look at this method in use.

```javascript
const yodaQuote= "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.";
const searchTerm = "Fear";

const index = yodaQuote.lastIndexOf(searchTerm);
console.log(index); //expected output: 35
```
In the example above the last appearance of the search term "Fear" starts at index 35 of the string.  

Here we include the optional fromIndex parameter and limit the search to 8 characters. The expected output
will be 0 because the last character in the string that is a match is located at the 0 index. 

```javascript
const yodaStr = "control, control, you must learn control!";

console.log(yodaStr.lastIndexOf("control", 8)); //expected output: 0
```

### substr() 

The substr() method is very similar to the slice() method that we looked at above but the
second parameter indicates how many characters from the start parameter we want to extract. 

```javascript
const yodaQuote = "Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.";

console.log(yodaQuote.substr(12, 5)); //expected output: "truth"
```
Just like the slice() method the second parameter is optional. If it is not included it will return the 
remainder of the string.

```javascript
const yodaQuote = "Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.";

console.log(yodaQuote.substr(50)); //expected output: "point of view."
```

### replace()

The replace method does what it sounds like, it replaces a certain portion of a string that we define using a pattern, with a 
replacement that we define. 
It is non-destructive and returns a new string. It takes a pattern as an argument, which can either be
a simple string or a RegExp. If the pattern is a string then it will match only the first occurrence and replace that match.

Here's a breakdown of the parameters. 

1. **Pattern** - This is either a Regular Expression or a simple string. If the pattern is 
a simple string then only the first match will be replaced.
2. **Replacement** - The replacement can either be a simple string or a function that will be
invoked when the pattern matches. 

Let's have a look at a basic example of the replace() method.

```javascript
let str = "I really hate working with strings in JavaScript";

let newStr = str.replace("hate", "love");
console.log(newStr); // expected output: "I really love working with strings in JavaScript"
```
You can use a Regex as the pattern instead of a string.

```javascript
let str = "I really hate working with strings in JavaScript";

let newStr = str.replace(/hate/i, "love");
console.log(newStr); // expected output: "I really love working with strings in JavaScript"
```
You can also use the global Regex flag to match all cases in the string. 

```javascript
let str = "I hate, hate, hate! Working with strings in JavaScript";

let newStr = str.replace(/hate/g, "love");
console.log(newStr); // expected output: "I love, love, love! Working with strings in JavaScript"
```

Replace() is a very powerful string method and one that we will have a closer look at in future posts.

## Wrap up

In this post we looked at some of the most commonly used string methods in JavaScript and their basic uses.
These are definitely great tools to have at our disposal when working with strings and can help 
us cut down on the amount of code we need to write. 

In the next post we will look at an example of how we can combine these methods.
