Loops are a very important concept in programming and the for loop is a classic. Almost all languages have an implementation of 
the for loop. 
They are foundational to control flow and can be found in most programs. 


Before we look specifically at a for loop in JavaScript, lets have a quick look at the features most programming loops share in common. 
The job of a loop is to loop through a portion of code over and over, which is called iteration. To iterate is to perform or repeat an action on each item in a set.
Loops in programming usually have the following features:

1. **Counter**. This is the starting point for the loop and will initial value. This will keep track of how many times we iterate over each item.
2. **Condition**. This condition will evaluate to either true or false and is used to determine if the loop should continue to run.
3. **Iterator**. The iterator will usually increments the counter by a set amount each loop.

## Standard for loop

Lets have a look at a for loop contruct.

1. **Initializer**. The initializer is an expression that is evaluated before the loop begins. The expression can be a variable decleration.
   This is usually used as a counter variable.
2. **Condition**. This expression will be evaluated once before every loop iteration. If this expression evaluates true then the code block will execute.
   The condition is optional. If not included the condition will evaluate to true. If false it will not cycle through the code
   block.
3. **Final-expression**. This expression is evaluated at the end of each iteration as long as the condition evaluates to true.
   This is often used to increment the counter.
4. **Statement**. This statement will execute if the condition evaluates to true.
   We can use multiple statements by grouping them with in a block statement using curly braces {}.

```javascript
for (Initializer; Condition; Final - expression) {
  //   code block to execute known as the statement.
}
```

Here's a classic example of using a for loop as a counter.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

Let's describe what's happening above.
We declare a variable called **i** ( which stands for index ) that is evaluated before the loop begins.
Then on every iteration of the loop, the condition checks to see if **i** is less than or equal to 10.
If that condition is true the final-expression executes and increments **i** by 1.
Then, since our condition was true the statement executes and logs the value of **i** to the console.

## Expressions are optional

The expressions in the for loop are optional. Here we do not include the initializer block in the for loop, we can
declare a variable outside of the for loop head.

```javascript
let i = 0
for (; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

Here we omit the condition so that it always evaluates to true.

```javascript
let i = 0
for (; ; i++) {
  console.log(i)
  if (i > 9) break
}
```

Because we are working with loops its important that we include logic that breaks out of the
loop once the a condition is met or we can create infinte loops. Infinte loops quicly fill up memory and can crash our program.
If you want to try it out yourself, just remove the if statement and break keyword from the example above.

And lastly we can remove the final-expression from the head of the for loop.
We still provide a way to increment the variable, this case in the block statement.

```javascript
let i = 0
for (;;) {
  console.log(i)
  if (i > 9) break
  i++
}
```

## Looping through arrays

Looping through arrays is a common task in JavaScript and the standard for loop can be a good choice depending on
your use case. We can iterate over an array with a standard for loop in the same way we layed out above.

```javascript
let animalsArray = ["lion", "tiger", "zebra", "elephant", "rhino"]

let i = 0
for (; i < animalsArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(animalsArray[i])
}
```

In the example above we have an array of animal names called **animalsArray**. Since arrays in JavaScript are
zero based, meaning that the first items index in the array is zero, we set the initializer to 0.

Then the condition that is set will be true as long as the initializer is less than the total length of the array.
We use the .length property on the **animalsArray** to indicate how many items are in the array. We for each loop iteration we simply log
each current item in the **animalArray** to the console.

Expected output:

```powershell
"lion"
"tiger"
"zebra"
"elephant"
"rhino"
```

The tricky part with using a standard for loop with arrays is when you are working with second level properties. You can nest for loops to solve this problem.
In those cases you'll likely need to declare a seperate index variable and will need to keep track of that as well.

```javascript
let allAnimals = [
  {
    animals: ["lion", "tiger", "zebra", "elephant", "rhino"],
  },
  {
    animals: ["cat", "dog", "bunny", "hamster"],
  },
];

let i = 0
for (; i < allAnimals.length; i++) {
  let childArray = allAnimals[i].animals

  for (let j = 0; j < childArray.length; j++) {
    console.log(childArray[j])
  }
}
```

Expected output:

```powershell
"lion"
"tiger"
"zebra"
"elephant"
"rhino"
"cat"
"dog"
"bunny"
"hamster"
```
As you can see nested for loops could become verbose in some circumstances so depending on your use case it might
be easier to employ an array method like forEach().  


## Wrap up

The for loop is a JavaScript classic and essential part of a JavaScript developers tool kit. Almost all languages have an implementaion of the 
for loop. Get to know how to use this powerful loop by using it in your next project. Be sure to check out
